ClarifAi let me use their community API Key that offers generously the first 5k requests for free, then I’ll have to use the essential plan that costs $1.20 / 1k operations which is a reasonable price in my opinion.</p>\n<h2 id=\"tools\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#tools\" aria-label=\"tools permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Tools</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>I used Adobe Illustrator to design the mobile icon</li>\n<li>Adobe XD to design the wireframes &#x26; user interfaces</li>\n<li>Kanban lean method to better handle project management using Trello</li>\n<li>Developed with React Native: (0.60.5)\n<ul>\n<li>Navigation: react-navigation (since the app is not that large otherwise I would have used react-native-navigation)</li>\n<li>Styling: styled-components</li>\n<li>Deployment: Fastlane</li>\n<li>Env variables: react-native-config</li>\n<li>State management: <del>redux</del> useReducer and useContext!</li>\n<li>HOCs: <del>Recompose</del> no more HOCs</li>\n<li>HTTP Requests: axios</li>\n<li>Forms: formik</li>\n<li>Form validation: yup</li>\n<li>Ads: react-native-admob</li>\n<li>Toast: react-native-simple-toast</li>\n<li>Upload: react-native-photo-upload</li>\n<li>Swiper: react-native-swiper</li>\n<li>Middleware: <del>redux-thunk</del> not anymore</li>\n<li>Prettier &#x26; Eslint for linting &#x26; formatting my code</li>\n<li>VSCode as code editor</li>\n<li>Image recognition: clarifai</li>\n<li>i18n: react-intl</li>\n<li>Analytics: react-native-mixpanel</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Feel free to download Ai Hashtags and leave your feedback on the app or down in the comments: <a href=\"https://ai-hashtags.com/?ref=0v3nb1rd\">Download Ai Hashtags</a></p>","timeToRead":3,"frontmatter":{"title":"Solving hashtags problems","date":"April 14, 2019","thumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","backgroundColor":"#181818","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/58adcd9869314527696b67b5c2636c5f/fa49c/hashtag.jpg","srcSet":"/static/58adcd9869314527696b67b5c2636c5f/b0c6e/hashtag.jpg 750w,\n/static/58adcd9869314527696b67b5c2636c5f/b3149/hashtag.jpg 1080w,\n/static/58adcd9869314527696b67b5c2636c5f/7b220/hashtag.jpg 1366w,\n/static/58adcd9869314527696b67b5c2636c5f/fa49c/hashtag.jpg 1920w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/58adcd9869314527696b67b5c2636c5f/4c1cf/hashtag.webp 750w,\n/static/58adcd9869314527696b67b5c2636c5f/2eb44/hashtag.webp 1080w,\n/static/58adcd9869314527696b67b5c2636c5f/05f36/hashtag.webp 1366w,\n/static/58adcd9869314527696b67b5c2636c5f/b2cf1/hashtag.webp 1920w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"100vw"}]},"width":1,"height":1.3338541666666666}}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/solving-hashtags-problems"}},
